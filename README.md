YAMTK
=====

This repository is yet another MonoTouch Kit. A collection of useful components ports and bindings for MT and some stuff made by my dev team.

The main objective of this repository is to keep all these good stuff out there updated and stable. 
All components here are always tested in the lastest MT version. At this moment only iOS 5+ is supported, but in a few  months only iOS6+ will be supported, including iOS7.
